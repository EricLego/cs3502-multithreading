CS 3502 Project 1 - Multi-Threaded Programming and Inter-Process Communication
This project implements multi-threading and inter-process communication (IPC) using pipes in C, demonstrating key operating system concepts such as:
  Thread management & synchronization (using mutexes)
  Deadlock detection & resolution
  Inter-process communication (IPC) using pipes
  Automated testing to validate code
